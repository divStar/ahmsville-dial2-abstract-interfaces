# AhmsVille Dial 2 abstract interfaces
This package contains abstract interfaces for the AhmsVille Dial 2.

The intention of this library is:
1. provide abstract interfaces for sensors
2. provide abstract interfaces for tasks
3. provide abstract interfaces for device variants
4. provide inheritable structures, that other Dial 2 related libraries can implement

> This library **is <u>not</u> supposed to** include **any** dependencies, especially no _Arduino_-exclusive ones.
