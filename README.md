# AhmsVille Dial 2 sensor adapter interfaces
This package contains the sensor adapter interfaces for the AhmsVille Dial 2.

The intention of this library is to provide abstract sensor adapter interfaces to decouple sensor-related operations
from the application firmware and hardware sensors in order to be able to test the firmware properly and develop a
device simulator.

> This library **is <u>not</u> allowed** to include **any** `Arduino` dependencies.

Refer to the generated Doxygen documentation for more details.
